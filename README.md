 - Object visibility - for old inventor versions where it was unable to assign shortcut to visibility function, however you can assign shortcut to macro that changes visibility
 - ShowWorkPlanes - Show/Hides XY, XZ and YZ work planes, and hides all other work planes of selected item (work plane is part of document, so it shows for all occurences of documnet in assembly)
